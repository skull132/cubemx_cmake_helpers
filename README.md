# What is this?

This is a set of CMake functions and files to help you compile the output
of CubeMX's generator. It's made to be as little intrusive as possible.
Most of the arguments you can provide to the functions yourself.

This tool does not invoke CubeMX for you. It doesn't even read the .ioc
file for the time being. It doesn't require Python.

It does depend on the structure of the generated ST project, though.

This tool also comes with a toolchain file which adds necessary compiler
definitions and flags to the compiler. This is necessary when integrating
libraries that get compiled with the same toolchain.

## What is supported?

Both LL and HAL projects are supported. Also enabling both should work fine.

Having the CubeMX code in a different subdirectory is also supported.

Supported and "does it compile?" tested MCU families:
* STM32F4
* STM32F3
* STM32F2
* STM32F1
* STM32F0

## What does this not support?

Libraries downloaded from CubeMX (like embedTLS or such) are not tested
currently. Probably don't work.

Feel free to PR support for'em. Just requires testing.

The toolchain file itself requires work as well. Currently a Linux style
case is assumed, where the compiler executables are globally accessible.

# Why is this?

Easy enough: I didn't find a decent CMake tool which would allow me to
wrap code generated by CubeMX into a CMake project. There are alternatives,
like [cubemx.cmake](https://github.com/patrislav1/cubemx.cmake), but I've
found that they try to do a little too much.

# How do I use this?

First, clone or copy the repo or its CMake files into a place where you can
`include()` them into your main `CMakeLists.txt`.

This guide will assume you cloned it into a subfolder `cubemx_cmake_helpers`.

Next, configure the CubeMX project.

## CubeMX Settings

The key settings are all in the "Project Manager" tab. Set the:

* **"Toolchain / IDE"** to "Makefile". Might work with others as well,
but only tested with this.
* Select **"Copy only the necessary library files"** checkbox from **"Code Generator"**. Compile errors will ensue otherwise.

The rest shouldn't affect the tool.

**Generate the code.**

## Toolchain configuration

You can use the toolchain file, `arm-none-eabi.cubemx.cmake`, to help
configure the `arm-none-eabi` toolchain to use proper flags and defines
for your CubeMX project. To do this, minimally, you have to pass the
following argument to your `cmake` command:

`-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cubemx_cmake_helpers/arm-none-eabi.cubemx.cmake`

However, the tooling **does not depend** on this toolchain file being used.

## CMakeLists.txt configuration

(See the example folder for an example `CMakeLists.txt`.)

Configure your CMake target as an **executable**, and note that the tool
assumes that the target's name ends with the suffix `.out`. Add your custom
source files, flags, etc. The tool shouldn't interfere with them.

Note that both C **and** ASM must be enabled as languages for the compiler,
otherwise the startup file is not going to be compiled and the application
will not boot properly.

Following this, invoke the `cube_configure_compiler_flags()`
and `cube_configure_target()` functions in your `CMakeLists.txt`. 

A very minimal example would look like this:

```cmake
enable_language(C CXX ASM)
# C and ASM are required. Otherwise startup.s isn't getting compiled.

include(cubemx_cmake_helpers/cubemx_target.cmake)

cube_configure_compiler_flags()

add_executable(myapp.out
  app/main.cpp # your own files
  app/my_class.cpp
)

cube_configure_target(myapp)
```

This will:

* Attempt to determine the MCU name again.
* Append MCU specific compiler flags to your already existing C, CXX, ASM,
and linker compiler flags.
* Glob the ST source files, add them to your target along with the include
dirs. Also adds the startup file.
* Configure the linker with the linker script.
* Adds a custom command to generate `myapp.bin` and `myapp.hex`. Along with
an appropriate clean configuration.

The function calls can be customized with further arguments, however:

```cmake
cube_configure_compiler_flags(
  MCU "STM32F401xE"
  ROOT_PATH ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}
  USE_HAL ON
  USE_LL OFF
  FLOAT_ABI "hard"
)

cube_configure_target(myapp
  MCU "STM32F401xE"
  ROOT_PATH ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}
  USE_HAL ON
  USE_LL OFF
)
```

With the arguments as follows:

* `MCU` The 5-place MCU code for the MCU that you're using. **Default value 
is automatically fetched from the project structure if possible.**
* `ROOT_PATH` The path for the generated CubeMX project. Default value is
`${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}`.
* `USE_HAL`, values `ON`/`OFF`. Default `ON`. Adds the `-DUSE_HAL_DRIVER` flag to the target
if `ON`.
* `USE_LL`, values `ON`/`OFF`. Default `OFF`. Adds the `-DUSE_LL_DRIVER` flag to the target
if `ON`.
* `FLOAT_ABI`, values `"hard"`/`"soft"`/`"softfp"`. Default `"hard"`. Modifies the
`-mfloat-abi` argument for compiler flags.
